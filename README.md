# Coursera Developing Data Products Week 4 Peer-graded Assignment: Shiny

In this project, we created a Shiny application and deployed it on RStudio's servers, and used R Presentations (also known as RStudio Presenter) to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about our application. 

The application is [published online on shinyapps.io](https://sebp.shinyapps.io/language-detection/) (will be online during the grading period of the Coursera Developing Data Products session, may be offline afterwards, but can be run offline on RStudio).

The presentation is [published online on GitHub Pages](http://spujadas.github.io/coursera-ddp-shiny/language-detection-app).

The source files for the language corpora are included this repository (in the `corpora` subdirectory): they were taken from the [2016 OpenSubtitles Frequency Word Lists](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords/) project, where they have been released under the MIT license.
